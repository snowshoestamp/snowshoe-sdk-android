## Installation

SnowShoe-Android-v2 is available through [jCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter). To install
it, add the following line to your projects `build.gradle`repositories:

```groovy
maven {
        url  "https://dl.bintray.com/snowshoestamp/maven" 
    }
```
and add the following line to your modules `build.gradle`dependencies:
```groovy
implementation 'com.mattluedke:snowshoelib:2.0.2'
```

## Usage

The core piece of this library is the `SnowShoeView`, a subclass of `View` that automatically detects stamps and handles the API query.

You can add one to your layout xml:

```xml
<com.mattluedke.snowshoelib.SnowShoeView
  ...
/>
```

Then, assign your key and secret from the [SnowShoe Dashboard](https://beta.snowshoestamp.com/applications/application/list/) to the view:

```java
snowShoeView.setAppKeyAndSecret("YOUR_APP_KEY", "YOUR_APP_SECRET");
```

Then, implement `OnStampListener`, which will be notified when a stamp request is made to the API and when a result comes back:

```java
public interface OnStampListener {
  void onStampRequestMade();
  void onStampResult(StampResult result);
}
```

Then assign the listener to the `SnowShoeView`:

```java
snowShoeView.setOnStampListener(listener);
```
